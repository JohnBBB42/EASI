# Electrochemical_methods

Electrochemical program for data analysis

## To do
- Amperometry
- create better user interfae
- better saving of results
- EIS and CV automatic parameters
- Square Wave Voltometry

Created using [mlops_template](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/mlops_template),
a [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for getting
started with Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).

Other techniques
Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV):
Sweeps the potential linearly in one direction, providing information similar to CV but in a single sweep.

Normal Pulse Voltammetry (NPV):
Applies discrete pulses and measures current at the end of each pulse to improve signal discrimination.

Stripping Voltammetry Techniques:

Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (ASV): Involves preconcentrating the analyte on the electrode and then oxidizing it.
Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CSV): Similar to ASV but involves reduction for stripping the analyte.
Adsorptive Stripping Voltammetry (AdSV): Uses adsorption to preconcentrate the analyte before its electrochemical determination.
Osteryoung Square Wave Voltammetry:
A variant of SWV optimized for high sensitivity and rapid analysis.

Potentiometry:
Involves measuring the electrode potential under near-zero current conditions, typically using ion-selective electrodes.

Chronoamperometry:
Monitors the current over time following a potential step to study reaction kinetics.

Chronopotentiometry:
Measures the change in potential over time at a constant current.

Galvanostatic Techniques:
Involves applying a constant current and observing the potential response.

Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM):
Provides spatially resolved measurements of electrochemical activity at or near surfaces.

Bulk Electrolysis (Controlled Potential Electrolysis):
Used for preparative electrochemistry, where a compound is completely oxidized or reduced under a constant potential.
